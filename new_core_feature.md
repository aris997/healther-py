# Sentinel Worker

A worker can be deployed away from the stack of services
so that that lives in another server/region/continent.

In doing this a very secure system is needed to let move
the informations. We may need a queue system message broker
the main point has all the ground truth, sentinels can send
results every minute (if they have any).
